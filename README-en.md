## About
### About the project
Project created in order to study the React library, following the introduction tutorial to React located on the [language website](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe). The original file has many steps that should have been deleted during the process, but I left them commented out so that I could study them in the future and during the project itself.
### About the game
The objective of the game is very simple, just as the game of tic-tac-toe is already well known. To play, two people must participate and play alternately, filling in the blanks.</br>
The step of each player is defined by X or O, and the objective of each is to form a line with three equal symbols, whether horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

 ## Installation
You can view the project without any installation via [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/marelps/pen/RwYvwwy), on the same site you can also view the entire line of code (without comments).
</br> </br>
You can also clone the repository locally via HTTPS, SSH and the GitHub CLI.
</br> </br>
Don't forget that you must install `node_modules` as it doesn't come bundled with the cloned repository. To install it use the command to install all the dependencies mentioned in the `package.json` file:
```
npm instal
```
After that, to run the project, use:
```
npm start
```

## Documentation
The React documentation can be found on [the library's website](https://react.dev/).
