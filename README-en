Tic Tac Toe project
Project created with the purpose of studying the React language, following the intro to react tutorial located on the language's own website [language's own website](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

Observations
The project was done locally using the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#create-react-app--), throughout the code you can see some comments made by me for annotation purposes and to understand the process done, there are also some changes of my choice in the CSS files of the project.
